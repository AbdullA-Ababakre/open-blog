It is quite commone to handle request or error locally,but what we have to do when we want to handle request globally.


You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by then or catch.

### [Intercepters](https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors)

This is especially useful for setting some common headers like authorization header maybe or if you want to log responses or want to handle errors globally.
