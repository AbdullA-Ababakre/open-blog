### what is Redux 

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. To rephrase that, it’s an application data-flow architecture, rather than a traditional library or a framework like Underscore.js and AngularJS.Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can’t be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers). you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library. It’s lightweight at 2KB (including dependencies), so you don’t have to worry about it making your application’s asset size bigger.

There are some terms in the redux,here in the below code , we can easily understand what they are .



````
const redux = require('redux');
const createStore=redux.createStore;

const initialState={
    counter:0
}

// Reducer
const rootReducer = (state=initialState,action) =>{
    if(action.type === 'INC_COUNTER'){
          return {
              ...state,
              counter:state.counter+1
          }
    }

    if(action.type === 'ADD_COUNTER'){
        return {
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter + action.value
        }
    }


    return state;
}

// Store
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
// console.log(store.getState());

// subscribe Actions
store.subscribe(()=>{
    console.log('[subscription',store.getState());
})

// Dispatching Actions
store.dispatch({type:'INC_COUNTER'});
store.dispatch({type:'ADD_COUNTER',value:5});

// console.log(store.getState());

### Why we need Redux 

at first, let's assume a context,we want to make a login  logout function,and there is a state indicating the state of the user logging status.And we want to get this state in many components,so far ,we know props,but it is one way data transfering.So we need to create a sort of global state where the state can be updated and persists to all other components . 


#### Three principles of Redux 

- There is only one source of truth. 
- State is read only.
- Changes are made with Pure Functions.

### Steps

0.) install the redux package

npm i redux 

1.create a store 

in the index.js(root of the whole file), we create the store and connect the reducer with it.

````

import reducer from './store/reducer'
import {createStore} from 'redux'

const store = createStore(reducer);

````

2.) install react-redux package

npm i react-redux

3.) connect the store to react 

````
import {Provider} from 'react-redux'
// wrap the <App /> in the Provider
ReactDOM.render(<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>, document.getElementById('root'));
````

4.)connect the react to redux 

in the component that we want to use redux , we should import  connect ;

for examle ,in the Counter component;
````
import {connect} from 'react-redux';
````
