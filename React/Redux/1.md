### what is Redux 

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. To rephrase that, it’s an application data-flow architecture, rather than a traditional library or a framework like Underscore.js and AngularJS.Redux maintains the state of an entire application in a single immutable state tree (object), which can’t be changed directly. When something changes, a new object is created (using actions and reducers). you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library. It’s lightweight at 2KB (including dependencies), so you don’t have to worry about it making your application’s asset size bigger.



### Why we need Redux 

at first, let's assume a context,we want to make a login  logout function,and there is a state indicating the state of the user logging status.And we want to get this state in many components,so far ,we know props,but it is one way data transfering.So we need to create a sort of global state where the state can be updated and persists to all other components . 


#### Three principles of Redux 

- There is only one source of truth. 
- State is read only.
- Changes are made with Pure Functions.
