$1.3K revenue. 6 weeks after launching. Lessons? Mistakes?

I launched my all in one AI tool around 6 weeks ago, and have been trying different growth channels to make it gain traction. I began with one sponsored post on YouTube long form, which I paid $150 for. Surprisingly, this one worked extremely well, generating an 6x ROI for me.

I wanted to test other channels too, though. So I spent around $200 on Instagram and $150 on TikTok, and I got a .6x ROI combined on both. I realized I shouldn't risk more money on short form, and went back to YouTube long form. I've rinsed and repeated this method for YouTube long form until where I am now.

But now I'm struggling to find new YouTubers to work with that will actually produce a good ROI and not charge $1.5k for a 1,000 view video.

I also want to start testing a little with different platform ads, like X, Reddit, and Meta ads.

Would love to hear your thoughts on what I should do from here on out to grow 10x in the next few months. The platform is ninjatools dot ai - an all in one AI tool with all top AI models in one place.
