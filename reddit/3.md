Naming the startup

I have built many projects and most of the time struggle with naming the product.

There is one product I am building, I called it ninjatools.ai,I like the term ninja, my product does all AI things in one place for one subscription, but my friends don't like the name. They want something abstract, something that has a much deeper meaning.

I thought about this for a long time. Let's take "Apple" for example - it is just a random name, yet Apple became one of the best-known brands all over the world.

Also "Reddit", "Vercel", "Clerk" - these names sound good and beautiful, but from the name alone, you cannot know what these companies do. What is your opinion on this?
