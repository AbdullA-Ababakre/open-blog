After working with a few remote people(in india and pakistan),my tolerance to the remote communication goes to zero. I just think for the startup company that might die anytime, remote work is really bad. The communication cut off , the ideas got cut off and the responses are just slow. 

Finally,I did a crazy thing,I and my little team all move in together under one roof,now we can communicate way faster and then also share ideas much more often. And I believe this is the most correct decision I have ever made.
