Hey fellow startup founders! Just wanted to share some amazing news - I managed to score $2.5K in OpenAI credits and $5K in AWS credits for my startup! ðŸŽ‰

I know how crucial these resources can be when you're bootstrapping, so let me break down exactly how I did it, in case it helps anyone else out there.

Getting OpenAI Credits ($2.5K worth):

First up, the OpenAI credits. This was actually pretty straightforward but requires a bit of preparation. Here's what worked for me:

1. Draft a detailed email to startups@openai.com
2. In the email, I talked about ninjatools[dot]ai (my startup building an all-in-one Everything app) and really emphasized how we're leveraging OpenAI's technology
3. I made sure to highlight all the specific OpenAI features we're using or planning to use
4. Pro tip: If you've attended OpenAI events (like dev day) or have any connection to OpenAI, definitely mention it! It helps build credibility
5. They'll respond with a form - fill it out thoroughly
6. That's it! The credits should come through pretty quickly

Securing AWS Credits ($5K):

The AWS process was even simpler:

1. Head over to https://aws.amazon.com/startups
2. You'll need to fill out a detailed application about your company
3. Be thorough with your company info - they want to understand your business
4. Wait a few days (they're pretty quick with responses)
5. Boom! $5K in credits to power your infrastructure

I know every dollar counts when you're building something new, so hopefully this helps someone else get these resources too! Let me know if you have any questions - happy to help fellow founders navigate this process. ðŸ’ª
