I launched my side project 4 weeks ago - an AI platform that lets you use 9+ AI apps in one (AI Music, AI Image generation, AI Chat with PDF, an AI library of tools, and 6 LLMs)

It's made $1.3k so far in revenue, but now it's not growing and I need to find a new strategy

I made the site in around two weeks, did one sponsored post that took off a little to get us our first few hundred in revenue. Since then I've done more influencer marketing but now it's not converting anymore.

Let me know if you have feedback on the site and any insight on how we can grow this.
