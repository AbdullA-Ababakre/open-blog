First Fire: It feels so bad

I am building an AI B2C SaaS. We have got some traction and got some paid customers. In order to make the team move faster, I found an engineer and with a lot of effort, I negotiated with him the things that he feels happy with and we can afford.

But things started getting not cool when we started working. Every single time, I had to explain a lot via Google Meet to him, and along the process he would ask a lot of questions, which made me wonder why I didn't just do it myself, which would be way faster.

Then I started making it step by step and messaging more, then he started getting annoyed. He said this is micromanaging.

If you talk with him, he will tell you he is a great engineer, but in reality, he cannot even run the template code.

After making him leave (actually I was not brave enough to say an official goodbye to him), I feel just relieved and bad.

What do you do in this kind of situation? We definitely need great engineers but we don't have big money to hire someone and make them just work as an employee. What I can do is give some dream + some percentage + if in SF, provide a place to sleep. Very scrappy way.
