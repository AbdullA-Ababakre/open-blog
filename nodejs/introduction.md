## what is nodeJs

nodeJs is the javascript runtime . It allows you to write javascript not only in browser.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

## why nodeJs

- fast

nodeJs is fast , the main reason is, nodeJs asynchronous .

Php and ASP handles the first request ,after finish the first request ,then handle the second request . when the server is opening the file + sending the response ,have to wait ,but nodeJs is different.When finish the first requst request process, it will ready to handle the next request.

- memory efficient

nodeJs runs single thread ,non-blocking ,asynchronous programming , whichi is moemory efficient.

## NodeJs modules

nodeJs modules is the same as the javascript library ,which can be considered as a set of functions included in your application.There are main three sources, one is built-in modules ,another is npm(a package managing tool),other is self-write modules.

### built-in modules

- http

  > allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

- file
  > allows you to work with the file system on your computer.
- url
  > The URL module splits up a web address into readable parts.

### npm modules

> https://www.npmjs.com/ hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.

let's first write a server demo .

```

// require the http module
const http = require('http');

// created the server
const server=http.createServer((req,res)=>{
   res.setHeader('Content-Type','text/html');
   res.write('<html>');
   res.write('<head><title>My First Page</title></head>');
   res.write('<body><h1>hello from my Node.js Server!</h1></body>');
   res.write('</html>');
   res.end();
})

// the port that we can listen to .
server.listen(3001);

```

we can see that in the localhost:3001 , there is the h1 text 'My First Page '
