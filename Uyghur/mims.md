Uyghur Cuisine
Mim is the nickname I gave myself when I was two years old watching my favorite cartoon. Cooking is not just learning or following recipes, it takes passion and love. The first meal I cooked was a surprise dinner for my parents at nine years old. I’ll never forget how beautiful the smiles on their faces were while they ate. I realized then that an artist is a creator of a truly beautiful and unforgettable moment. I don’t consider myself a professional chef, but I do know that I am an artist. I created these meals with my passion and love. I hope you all enjoy!
