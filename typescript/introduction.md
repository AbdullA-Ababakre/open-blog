## why we use Typescript

Typescript is a 'superset' to the javascript . syntacs are based on the core javascript ,but added the static type . 

below ,use a small demo to show you why we use Typescript.

````
function add(a,b){
    reuturn a+b;
}
const result1 = add(2,5);
console.log(result1);    //7

const result2=add('2','5');
console.log(result2);   //25

````

we can see that , when we write the javascript code , we do not know exactly what kind of parameters we use to pass to the add function , if we pass string params , it will cause problems . This is why typescript comes .

with typescript , we can just specify thAe type of parameters just simply by `: `, and spot the errors before running the code . 


````
function add(a:number,b:number){
    reuturn a+b;
}
````

## How to use Typescript 

1.) install the Typescript 

````
npm install -g typescript
````

2.) run the typescript code

````
tsc filename.ts // the typescript file name 
````

there are also other useage ,like use with ReactJs , you can just create a react-typescript project with npx 

````
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
````

## basic syntax

### Typing

The type system allows you to add types to variables ,function arguments and function return types,giving a more rigid structure to your program .

The advantages are better tooling :

- detact the bugs in advance(editors like vscode , can help you a lot during development,poing out bugs as you write the code.)

- teamwork get easier because the code is more explicit.

### Typesystem 

there are mainly two types of type system and we can use `:` or by inference to define them .

- Primitive: number,string,boolean(if it is Number,String,Boolean ,which starts with big letter , it will be number object , instead of number primitive),bigint, null, symbol, and undefined,any (allow anything), unknown (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), never (itâ€™s not possible that this type could happen), and void (a function which returns undefined or has no return value).

- Complex type : objects,arrays

#### Type inference 


below two lines of code is the same ,first line we difine the type by inference . Typescript knows the javascript and will genereate the types for you in many cases .  For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value ,Typescript will use the value as its type . 

````
let helloWorld = 'hello world';
let helloWorld:string = 'hello world';
````

#### Defining Types with `:`

One can use a wide variety of design patterns in Javascript and some makes it difficult for types to inferred automatically . To cover these cases , Typescript offers places for you tell Typescript what the type should be by `:`;

below is the demo to show how to define types ,

````

<!-- number variable  -->

let a : number = 4;

<!-- string array  -->

let hobbies:string[] = ["reading",'swimming'];

<!--   -->

let person : {
    name:'string',
    age:'number'
}

// this is right
person={ 
    name:'Abdulla',
    age:24
}

// this is wrong 
person = {
    interest:'reading'
}

<!-- Array of object -->

let people: {
    name: string,
    age: number
}[];

people = [{
    name: "ab",
    age:34
},
    {
    name: "abc",
    age:34
}
];

<!-- or can use interface kwyword to explicitly describe the shape of the variable -->

interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Hayes",
  id: 0,
};
````

for fucntions 

````
function getAdminUser(): User {
  //...
}

function deleteUser(user: User) {
  // ...
}
````

### Union types 

specify more than one type to the variables.

````
let course : string | number = 'react-course';

course = 1234;

<!-- describe the set of string or number literals that a value is allowed to be: -->
type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";

````


### Generics

helps we write safe yet flexiable functions.It provide variables to types. In short, you can create a function, interface or class that works with different types, without specifying the type up front.

````
// any is too general ,and it loses the meaning of using typescript

function insertAtBegining(array:any[],value:any) {
    let newArr = [value, ...array];
    return newArr;
}

// if we specify the type number , this function will lost it's utility 

function insertAtBegining(array:number[],value:number) {
    let newArr = [value, ...array];
    return newArr;
}

// if we specify the type string , this function will lost it's utility 

function insertAtBegining(array:string[],value:string) {
    let newArr = [value, ...array];
    return newArr;
}

const demoArr = [1, 2, 3];

const updatedArr = insertAtBegining(demoArr, 4);
````

````
// more generic functions

function insertAtBegining<T>(array:T[],value:T) {
    let newArr = [value, ...array];
    return newArr;
}
````
