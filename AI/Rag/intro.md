# Embedding


An embedding is a way to represent complex data, such as images, text, or audio, as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space.For example , 
the word dog is [0.1, 0.2, 0.3].


# Vector database

A vector database is a specialized database designed to efficiently store, manage and query dense vector representations of data, such as embeddings.

# How does RAG work 

Can be divided into two steps:

- Ingestion stage: preprocess the external knowledge and prepare for retrival  

- Inference stage : the model retrieves relevant data from the external knowledge base, augments it with the userâ€™s prompt, and generates a response.
